# Integration Testing and AJAX refresher - Front-end

A simple app so you can practice integration testing in Javascript. This is the front-end. The back-end can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/ajax-testing-be)

## Initial Setup


1. See if you have the JDK installed: `javac -version`

2. If you don't, [download the JDK here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

6. Install the dependencies from `package.json`:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```

## Run the Server

To see your code in action, you need to fire up a development server. Use the command:

```shell
npm start
```

Once the server is running, visit in your browser:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.

## Run Tests in the Terminal

To run all of your tests:

```js
npm test
```
